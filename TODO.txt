Test-driven Development:
==================================

Stages:
      I. Single machine basic ELM
     II. Multi-machine basic ELM
    III. Parallel regularization
     IV. High-performance solvers
      V. Other algorithms (OS-ELM)


I. Single machine basic ELM

Acceptance tests:
    1. Run ELM on Sine data
    2. Run ELM on Sine data in Matlab

Walking skeleton:
    1. Load data
    2. Train ELM
    3. Report LOO error

Refactor testing:

    Datasets, various problem sizes, times and speed-up
    
        0. Run ELM on Iris dataset (classification, unittest)
        1. Run ELM on Breast cancer dataset (binary)
        2. Run ELM on Wine dataset (classification, easy)
        3. Run ELM on Housing dataset (regression)
        4. Run ELM on Power consumption dataset (regression, bigger)
        5. Run ELM on Song year dataset (regression, bigger)
        6. Run ELM on MNIST dataset (classification, very big)
        7. Run ELM on HIGGS dataset (binary, out-of-memory)

    Data formats:
    
        0. Test saving to .txt
        1. Test loading from .txt
        2. Test saving to .h5
        3. Test loading from .h5

    ELM functionality:

        0. Test save and load model

        1. Test correct projections and transformations

        2. Test model initializing

        3. Test singular inputs (1-dim), classification targets

        

















Unit Testing - Work Units

	1. Test adding neurons to ELM
		a. Create ELM with fixed dimensionality of inputs and outputs 
		b. Add neurons with type
		c. Add neurons several times
		d. Add linear neurons (type "None")
		e. Add multiple different types of neurons
		f. Add neurons with type, projection matrix and bias
		g. Add multiple neurons with type, projection matrix and bias
		h. Add single neuron with parameters
		i. Add neurons with custom transformation function


	2. Test basic ELM
		a. Data is projected correctly without bias
		b. Data is projected correctly with bias
		c. Single neuron solves XOR problem (100 initializations)
		
		d. Targets can have 1 or 2 dimensions
		 . Inputs and targets must have same number of samples
		 . Inputs must have correct dimensionality
		 . Targets must have correct dimensionality
		 . ELM must have neurons for training
		 . ELM must be trained for running

		j. Solve Iris problem with ELM
				
				
	3. Distributed ELM (MPI)
				
	    a. Calculate matrix H distributively, get same results			
				
				
		
	2. Save and load ELM model
		a. Get and set ELM model, obtain same results
		b. Save and load ELM model, obtain same results
	
	
	3. OP-ELM
		a. Decrease training error with OP-ELM
	
	4. TROP-ELM (fast and full modes)
	
	5. Solvers and different precision
	
	6. Matlab interface
	
	
	8. Distributed OP-ELM
